    <h1>My Favourite Travel Destination</h1>

    <p>The Bhavnath Mahadev temple is a shrine ensconced in myths and legends of the Puranic era, at the base of Mount Girnar in Bhavnath village. The Shiva ling here is said to have emerged of its own divine intention. Reportedly, when Shiva and Parvati were traveling over the Girnar Hills their divine garment fell over the present Mrgi Kund, making this place an auspicious site for lord Shiva worshipers. Even today, the naga bavas [Naked sadhus] bathe in the holy Mrgi Kund before joining the Mahashivaratri procession. The fair itself is so ancient that its precise origins are unknown.</p>
